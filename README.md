The Bad Pairs is random badminton team making flutter application. 

## Why this app ?
So the main idea behind or the problem it solves is for badminton players. Where I and my friends play there always goes a debate to choose players in their team. While choosing a partner in a game can make the game un-balanced with skills of playing, can leads unfair advantages to strong team. So idea behind this app came in existence, **why not have random pairing**.

## Usage
The Bad pair apk provides fast random teamup. By using this app our team making process get faster. Before / Without app, teaming up regularly everyday was very time consuming and arguable process, but now the apps decide who will be with whom as a partner and everyone agrees easily. Moreover the apps also generates the possible matches for each badminton team. Score board feature and other requirement are to be implemented.

## How you can use it ?
Actually for now it is specifically designed for badminton. If your problem is same in your free game period and have limited time to play. Then you can **use it just by downloading** the latest release apk from [here](https://github.com/Jake1924/The-Bad-Pairs/releases)

## Scope & Future
The Bad Pairs is a working application and doing its job perfectly for what it is originated for. But as any game doesn't constraint with only a single problem, thus it gonna have other features too. Some of the idea I have are
 
    - Scoreboard for the match
    - Statistics of the players win

## Contributing
This project is scopes the two player teaming for now like badminton, but you can add for
other games as well. Also you can add some own algorithm of teaming or discuss how you gonna do it. I would love your any thoughts of contribution. Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. 

Please make sure to update readme as appropriate.
